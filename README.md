# Chorus
Compare LLMs in their native browser UI.

## Overview

Chorus lets you start conversations with the top LLM chatbots directly from your browser's omnibox. Type a message like "Plan a trip to Athens next week" once, and watch as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini each open in their own tabs.

This can be useful if you're looking to ensemble the responses of various LLMs, eg on a query like "give me gift ideas...", or if you're looking to compare the responses of top LLMs. Since it uses the native browser UI for each chatbot (rather than making API calls), you can use all the custom UI affordances these chatbots offer like code extensions and conversation links. This also lets you use your existing subscriptions rather than being charged for API access.
